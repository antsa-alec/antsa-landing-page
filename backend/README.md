# ANTSA Landing Page Backend

Secure backend API with authentication and content management system for the ANTSA landing page.

## Features

- üîê **Secure Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- üìù **Content Management**: Full CRUD operations for all landing page content
- üñºÔ∏è **Image Upload**: Secure image upload and management
- üóÑÔ∏è **SQLite Database**: Lightweight, file-based database (easily upgradable to PostgreSQL)
- üîí **Server-Side Auth**: All authentication happens server-side, not in the client
- üì° **RESTful API**: Clean, well-structured API endpoints

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment

The `.env` file has been created with default development settings. **IMPORTANT**: Change the JWT_SECRET in production!

### 3. Initialize Database

Run the seed script to create the database, tables, and initial content:

```bash
npm run seed
```

This will create:
- Database schema with all necessary tables
- Initial admin user (credentials configured separately via update-admin.js)
- Initial content from the current landing page

**‚úÖ SECURITY**: Admin credentials are securely configured via separate script.

### 4. Start the Server

Development mode with auto-reload:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Production mode:
```bash
npm start
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3001`

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"YOUR_USERNAME","password":"YOUR_PASSWORD"}'
```

## Database Schema

### Tables

- **users**: Admin users with hashed passwords
- **sections**: Page sections (hero, features, pricing, etc.)
- **content**: Text content for each section
- **images**: Uploaded images with metadata
- **feature_items**: Feature cards
- **pricing_plans**: Pricing plan details
- **testimonials**: Client testimonials
- **team_members**: Team member profiles

## Security Features

1. **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with salt rounds
2. **JWT Tokens**: Expiring tokens (24h default)
3. **CORS Protection**: Configurable allowed origins
4. **Input Validation**: express-validator on all inputs
5. **File Upload Restrictions**: Image files only, 5MB limit
6. **SQL Injection Protection**: Prepared statements
7. **Server-Side Authentication**: No client-side auth logic

## Production Deployment

Before deploying to production:

1. ‚úÖ Change `JWT_SECRET` to a strong random string
2. ‚úÖ Admin password securely configured
3. ‚úÖ Update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to your production domain
4. ‚úÖ Set `NODE_ENV=production`
5. ‚úÖ Consider using PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
6. ‚úÖ Enable HTTPS
7. ‚úÖ Set up proper logging and monitoring
8. ‚úÖ Regular database backups

## Troubleshooting

**Database locked error**:
- Make sure only one instance of the server is running
- Check file permissions on `content.db`

**CORS errors**:
- Add your frontend URL to `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in `.env`

**Token errors**:
- Verify `JWT_SECRET` is set correctly
- Check token hasn't expired (24h default)
